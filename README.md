## FormsUI
This was taken from FormAPI Github Repo and another author's repo and I have decided to create my own repo to implement forms, and this is for PM4 that I will be maintaining for the long run and would like to try improving it as it goes.

This virion is for API 4.0.0/PocketMine-4.0.0+
